# Concurrent Scalable Counter in Go

## Overview

This Go program implements a scalable counter using an approximate counting technique. It manages a global counter and multiple local counters, one for each CPU core, reducing contention and improving performance on multicore systems.

## Key Features

Approximate Counter: Utilizes local counters to minimize contention on the global counter, improving scalability.
Synchronization: Employs mutexes to ensure thread safety when updating both local and global counters.
Components
Structs
Counter: Holds the global counter, local counters, and associated locks.
Methods
Init(threshold int): Initializes the counter with the given threshold.
Update(threadID int, amt int): Updates the local counter for the given thread ID and aggregates it into the global counter if necessary.
Get() int: Returns the current value of the global counter.

## Main Function

Initializes the counter with a threshold value.
Launches goroutines for concurrent updates to the counter.
Retrieves the approximate counter value after all updates.

### Usage

Running the Program
Initialize the Counter: Use the Init method to set up the counter with a specified threshold.
Concurrent Updates: Multiple goroutines call the Update method to increment the counter.
Retrieve the Counter Value: Use the Get method to obtain the approximate value of the counter after all updates.

#### Performance Considerations

Scalability: Local counters minimize contention on the global counter, enhancing scalability in multicore systems.
Accuracy vs. Performance: Adjust the threshold value to balance accuracy and performance; higher thresholds improve performance but reduce real-time accuracy.
